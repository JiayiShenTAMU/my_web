# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "We propose a unified model and embedding compression (UMEC) framework to hammer an efficient neural network-based recommendation system.  Our framework jointly learns input feature selection and neural network compression together, and solve them as an end-to-end resource-constrained optimization problem using ADMM. "
