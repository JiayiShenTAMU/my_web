# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "We introduce the learning to optimize (L2O) methodology to the minimax problems for the first time, and addresses its accompanying unique challenges. We present Twin L2O, the first dedicated minimax L2O framework consisting of two LSTMs for updating min and max variables, respectively. We then discuss a crucial concern of Twin-L2O, i.e., its inevitably limited generalizability to unseen optimizees, and present two complementary strategies."
